# Box Plot :
A boxplot, also known as a box-and-whisker plot, is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset. It displays the median, quartiles, and potential outliers in a clear and concise manner. The "box" represents the interquartile range (IQR), while the "whiskers" extend to show the data's spread, making it easy to identify data skewness and central tendency.

# Heatmap:
A heatmap is a visual representation of data in a matrix form, where values are depicted as colors on a grid. It is commonly used to display relationships or patterns in a dataset by assigning colors to data points based on their values. Warm colors (e.g., red) often represent high values, while cool colors (e.g., blue) represent low values. Heatmaps are valuable for visualizing correlations, trends, or variations in large datasets.

# PairPlot:
A pairplot is a grid of scatterplots and histograms used to explore pairwise relationships between variables in a multivariate dataset. It provides a visual overview of how variables interact with each other, making it easier to identify correlations and patterns. Pairplots are particularly valuable in exploratory data analysis to uncover insights and guide further analysis.

# CountPlot:
A count plot is a type of data visualization commonly used in data analysis and statistics to display the frequency or count of categorical data. It is often employed to summarize and visualize the distribution of categorical variables, such as the number of occurrences of different categories within a dataset.

# Tree Plot:
A tree plot, in a general context, is a graphical representation of a hierarchical structure, where elements are organized in a tree-like fashion. This type of visualization is commonly used in various fields to display relationships, hierarchies, and branching structures.
